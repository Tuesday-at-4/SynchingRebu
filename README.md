Rebu is an application that allows people to sign up to get or provide a ride. 
Users will be required to create a profile before they can access the core features. 
Users will be able to choose to be either a driver or a passenger. 
As a passenger, the user will be able to schedule a start and end location for a ride on a certain date or time. 
Once the Ride Request has been made, a driver in the area can accept the ride request. 
After the Ride, the users can provide feedback on the ride, and the payment will be charged. 
The passengers will pay a fee based on the distance of the ride and the drivers will be paid an amount according to similar metrics.

To be able to use the application you must first create an account.
Afterwards you must choose whether you want to be a driver or passenger then you can procceed to 
either work as a driver or become a passenger looking for rides.
